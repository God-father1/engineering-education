"Automation is about innovation", and one such innovation is what we call the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is an arrangement of interrelated processing gadgets, mechanical and advanced machines given one-of-a-kind identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to move information over a system without expecting human-to-human or human-to-PC connection.

### Introduction
Through [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), someone can easily connect any device with anything, anywhere in the world over the internet. This has termed the phrase Internet of Everything and Internet of Humans, IoT is a network between “Things with Things” and “Things with Human”. “Internet of Things (IoT) is a platform where anything can be inspected, supervised, and executed from anywhere over the internet.”
Connecting a simple device (Home or Commercial) to sensors, actuators with microcontrollers (and more) helps users connected to those devices have better active management, and in a sense easier and better lives with customized applications all done via the internet.

### History of IOT

-	1970 - The real idea of associated gadgets was proposed.

-	1990 - John Romkey made a toaster that could be turned on/off over the Internet.

-	1995 - Siemens presented the main cell module worked for M2M.

-	1999 - The expression "Web of Things" was utilized by Kevin Ashton during his work at P&G which turned out to be generally acknowledged.

-	2004 - The term was referenced in acclaimed distributions like the Guardian, Boston Globe, and Scientific American.

-	2005 - UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) distributed its first report on this theme.

-	2008 - The Internet of Things was conceived.

-	2011 - Gartner, the statistical surveying organization, incorporate "The Internet of Things" innovation in their examination.




### How does it work?
Gadgets and devices with built-in sensors are associated with an Internet of Things platform, which gathers information from these gadgets and applies examination to impart the most important data to applications worked to address explicit necessities.
These amazing IoT stages can pinpoint precisely what data is helpful and what can securely be overlooked. This data can be utilized to recognize designs, make proposals, and distinguish potential issues before they happen.
For instance, in the event that somebody owns a vehicle manufacturing business, one should know which discretionary parts (cowhide seats or combination wheels, for instance) are the most mainstream. Utilizing IoT innovation, one can:

 - Use sensors to recognize which areas in a showroom are the most mainstream, and where clients wait longest.
 - Insight of deals and information to recognize which segments are selling quickest.
 - Automatically adjust deals information to flexibly, with the goal that well-known things don't leave stock.


This gathered data helps an organization to make stratagies in order to be in demand in market by performing data analysis about which parts to load up on, in light of continuous data, which leads to businesses saving time and cash.
With the knowledge given by cutting edge examinations also comes the ability to make informed and productive decisions. You can also robotize certain undertakings, especially when these are redundant, typical, repetitive or even hazardous.
How about taking a brief overview of some major excelling areas which implement IoT? Below are major fields which are utilizing IoT technology to enhance living standards -


### **Smart home**

   - IoT gadgets are a part of home devices, which can incorporate lighting, warming, cooling, media, and security frameworks.  A smart home or computerized home can found controlling brilliant gadgets and machines.
   - For example, utilizing Apple's HomeKit, makers can have their home items constrained by an application in iOS gadgets, for example, the iPhone and the Apple Watch.

### **Manufacturing**

    - **[Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0)**, the fourth modern transformation, envelops a mix of conventional assembling and mechanical stages and practices with the most recent keen innovations. This fundamentally centers around the utilization of huge scope machine-to-machine correspondence [(M2M)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine) and IoT arrangements to give expanded computerization, improved correspondence, and self-checking, just as smart machines that can investigate and analyze issues without the requirement for human intervention.

### **Agriculture**
   - Agriculture on an average contributes to 30% (estimated) of the economy of any country. Smart farming based on IoT technologies enables growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity.
   - IoT smart farming solutions is a system that is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere.
   - For example, if the soil moisture level decreases, the farmer can deploy sensors to start the irrigation. Smart farming is highly efficient when compared with the conventional approach.


### Importance and Application

Over time, the definition of IoT has evolved, so has its application in the real world. Currently, IoT is not only connecting machines and humans but also indirectly connecting humans all over the world with each other (i.e. Smart-watches, Mobile-Phones etc.). IoT is what we get when we join “Things” which are operated by humans, to the Internet.
    Increasing the interaction between the devices and humans by the introduction of Internet technology has clear vision of achieving the goal of automation, increased efficiency, interoperability, increased and quality production and many more goals on the way. Unlike a human being, the machine is not that susceptible to errors and laziness, therefore to have error-free work, sound production, accurate data collection, improved quality with increased quantity, and increased efficiency.
This has led to the vision of ‘anytime, anywhere, anyway, anything' communications. Practically in true sense. Significant applications of IoT in the present day are:
